# Collection Helpers TODO
- Built-in `Split()` returns a String() array.
- Suggest `SplitToCollection`
- Suggest `SplitToDictionary` (element in both key and value)
- Suggest `JoinFromCollection`
- Suggest `JoinFromArray` (String() array)
- Suggest `JoinFromVariantArray` 
## Methods
- Most important are Clear and Exists
## And and Linq
- Do we need an Exists that checks multiple existence elements?
    - e.g. `ExistsAll` and `ExistsAny` (at least one) and `ExistsOne` (exactly)
